# Rock-Blast
It is my first game. It is an android game. I have made it independently and alone in about 2-3 weeks. Hope you like it and I will be awaiting for improvements or any offers. 

It is an android game. if you wanna play it then you must make a build using unity engine. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: I have made the code this way they you can play it on Windows/MacOS as well as Android. Currently it is set for windows to switch it to Android Just open the PlayerMMovement Script and in the Update() Method/Function on line 65 you will find an if() statement which will be currently set to false, just make that true if you want to play on Android and make it back false it you wanna play on Android. If it is true it will only work for Android and not for Windows/MacOS and vica-versa
